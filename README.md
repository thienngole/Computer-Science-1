# Computer-Science-1
Hello,
My name is ThienNgo Le. I am currently doing my bachelor of computer science at Metropolitan State University of Denver. This repository includes all java program that I did in my Computer Science 1 class.

1. ThienNgoLe_01.java: This program asks the user to input two real numbers,
calculates the average of these numbers, and display the result.

2. ThienNgoLe_02.java: This program asks the user to input three sides of a triangle,
    calculates the perimeter and the area of the triangle and displays the results.

3. ThienNgoLe_03.java:JOptionPane is used in this program. This program asks the user to input three sides of a triangle, calculates the perimeter and the area of the triangle and displays the results.

4. ThienNgoLe_04.java:  This program uses files for input and output to read a file of numbers then calculate the sum and average of them.

5. ThienNgoLe_05.java: This program calculates area of a triangle using methods

6. ThienNgoLe_06.java: This program calculates mileage reimbursement based on a table
    The Mathematical Association of America hosts an annual summer meeting.  Each state sends one official delegate to the section officers’ meeting at this summer session.  The national organization reimburses the official state delegates according to the scale at the bottom of the page.  Write a Java program to calculate the reimbursement values, satisfying the following:
    1.Read data from a file and write data to a file. All data written to the output file should be echoed on the console. There should be only one input file and only one (separate) output file. The files are named, respectively,
        a.	YourName_S_07_Input.txt		
        b.	YourName_S_07_Output.txt
    2.The first line of the input file contains an integer number of data values to process.  After the first line of the input file, each line contains a real number which is the number of miles. Use a while loop to process the mileage values from the input file. 
    3.Use an “if/else/if” construct and the scale below to calculate the mileage reimbursement if the input value is > 0. We’ll discuss an alternative method in class that you can use if you want.
    4.The main method should declare all the variables at the start. Do not use a separate class for storage. Create at least the following methods, both called from main:
        a.	Method to print heading for the table
        b.	Method to output the summary information
        Also use the leftPad method in the Toolkit to pad numbers.
    5.Output the results to the file and to the console in a table format. There should be one line of output for each mileage value processed.  There should be a heading for each of the columns of the table.  The columns of the table should be lined up by the decimal point which can be done using the leftPad method. Each detail line of the table will contain the number of miles (double – print with one decimal place) and the reimbursement amount (double – print with two decimal places).  If the input value is <= 0, output five stars in place of the reimbursement amount.
    6.After all the data values have been processed, output to the file the total of the reimbursement values, the number of mileage values processed, and the number of mileage values that are > 0.  Include phrases to identify each of the numbers.
    
    10    250.6   99.4    -2.78    999.4    799.4    1899.8    0   1300.2    1101.7   3333.3
    Reimbursement scale:
    Round trip mileage                        Rate
    less than 400 miles			18 cents per mile
    ≥ 400, < 900 miles			$ 65.00 plus 15 cents for each mile over 400 
    ≥ 900 miles, < 1300 miles		$115.00 plus 12 cents for each mile over 900
    ≥ 1300, < 1900 miles			$140.00 plus 10 cents for each mile over 1300
    ≥ 1900, < 2600 miles			$165.00 plus 8 cents for each mile over 1900
    ≥ 2600 miles			$195.00 plus 6 cents for each mile over 2600

7. ThienNgoLe_07.java: This program produces a report in an output file based on the range of grades.
    Write a Java program that reads from one file and writes to a second file. The program processes input lines until the end of file. Read and process the input file in one pass through of the file. All output should be to one file.  Each line in the input file contains an integer followed by a name as shown below. Use a String to store the name. The main method should contain all the variables. Create a printed report that consists of a table with appropriate headings. The columns of the report contain the name, value, and then a message in that order.  The message is “OUTSTANDING” if the value is 90 or more; “Satisfactory” if the value is between 70 and 89 inclusive; “FAILING” otherwise.  Use "if/else/if" or a table-driven approach. Use methods to line up the columns of the report. Use the padString method to output the name (a string) to a specified width, and a leftPad method for the value. Use Toolkit for the leftPad and padString methods. After all the data lines have been processed, print with messages the number of data lines processed, and the number and real average of the values between 70 and 89 inclusive. The average is formatted to one decimal place.
    Follow the documentation guidelines. Methods must be used at least for the heading of the table and for the summary of the table.

8. ThienNgoLe_08.java: arrays and methods are used in this program. This program calculates mileage reimbursement based on a table

9. ThienNgoLe_09.java: This program asks the user  to input three sides of a triangle and print the results. It uses the class ThienNgoLe_5_09_Triangle to hold the length of sides.
    Methods used:
        explain() - expalin the program to the user outputResults(ThienNgoLe_5_09_Triangle theSides, double area) - outputsides of a triangle and its area
    Class methods used:
        getSides() - get valuas for the sides obtained from the user
        calcArea() - return the area of the triangle
        outputSides() - ouput the values of the sides and message
